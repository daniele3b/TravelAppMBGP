# TravelAppMBGP
This is the project that I've developed during the Mercedes AMG F1 interview for Race Software Engineer job, I passed the selective steps ( curriculum selection, technical project, technical and behavioral interview) but I was not hired but it was a great challenge from which I learned a lot.

This is a project developed to manage  the problem of the travels of the formula 1 team around the world in particular in the states belonging to the Schengen pact: in these states it is forbidden to stay for more than 90 days in a 180-day mobile window.

The time allotted to me for the development of the project is 7 days where it was required to focus on the functions related to the calculation of days, insertion (removal, etc.) of events for each type of user:
- Team member
- Travel Department
